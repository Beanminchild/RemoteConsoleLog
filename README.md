# RemoteConsoleLog
App to let my Ababoo lab see the progress of their compilations  without needing to be near their computer.


## How to Use

To use RCL simply open the app specify the process you want to monitor i.e python, python3, R, Rscript etc and the program will conitnuously monitor for any matching processes and let you know when they start when they finish. If the process finished with an error it will communicate that error and give you a link to duck.ai to help you solve it.
