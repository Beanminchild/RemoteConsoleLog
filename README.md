# RemoteConsoleLog
App custom built to allow Abebayehu lab researchers to see the progress of their compilations  without needing to be near their computer.


## How to Use

To use RCL simply open the app specify the process you want to monitor i.e python, python3, R, Rscript etc and the program will continuously monitor for any matching processes and let you know when they start when they finish. If the process finished with an error it will communicate that error and give you a link to duck.ai to help you solve it. 


## Disclaimer 
This app is open source and therefore free to use for anyone but updates and features will be tailored to the needs of the Abebayehu lab.
